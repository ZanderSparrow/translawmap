## Developer Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Available Scripts

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
